Instructions for compilation
============================
After untaring the tarball, there will be five directories with the following names

step-1-find-initial-point
step-2-minimize-on-cusp
step-3-slide-down
step-4-collect-structures
step-5-make-pathway

Go to each of these directories and type "make".

After compilations executables used in the following steps are arranged as follows

"1_locate_struct_on_cusp_v2" is in "step-1-find-initial-point"
"2_find_min_on_cusp_v4" is in "step-2-minimize-on-cusp"
"3_desc_one_surface_v3" is in "step-3-slide-down"
"4_collec_ener_v2" is in "step-4-collect-structures"
"5_makepathway_v2" is in "step-5-make-pathway"

Copy all these executables in the current directory.

 $ cp step-1-find-initial-point/1_locate_struct_on_cusp_v2 .
 $ cp step-2-minimize-on-cusp/2_find_min_on_cusp_v4 .
 $ cp step-3-slide-down/3_desc_one_surface_v3 .
 $ cp step-4-collect-structures/4_collec_ener_v2 .
 $ cp step-5-make-pathway/5_makepathway_v2 .

 

Instructions for running the ANMPathway method
==============================================
Commands are preceded with $.

The entire calculation is divided in several steps.

Step 0: Generating input files
------------------------------

Step 0.1: Preparation of initial structure files
------------------------------------------------

In this step two PDB files for the two end states are processed and converted to multiple input files.

Perform the following steps:

a. Edit the "INPUT_INFO_STRUCTURES" file.
   - First line contains the names of the two input PDB files. First entry is for
     end state 1 and the second entry is for end state 2.
   - First character of the second line is the chain id. The rest of the line specifies the
     residue range that will be included in the calculation. If you have multiple chains
     then there should be one such line for each chain.
	 
b. Run the script "prepare_input_strucutre_files.tcl"
  
    $ vmd -dispdev none -e prepare_input_strucutre_files.tcl
   
   Input PDB files need to be in the same directory. This step will produce the following 
   output files
   - 1_CA.pdb
   - 2_CB.pdb
   - INPUT_STRUCTURE_1
   - INPUT_STRUCTURE_2
   - PDB_INFO
   - REFERENCE_FOR_ALIGNMENT
   - structure_prep.log


Step 0.2: Prepare other input files
-----------------------------------

Get the number of atoms in the system from "structure_prep.log" file and edit 
"create_input_files_ANMPathway.pl" file. Change other parameters such as cut-offs, force constans,
target RMSD of the pathway etc. as necessary. Run the script "create_input_files_ANMPathway.pl"
  
  $ ./create_input_files_ANMPathway.pl
   
This step will produce the following output files
  - INPUT_FIND_STRUCTURE_ON_CUSP
  - INPUT_MINIMIZE_ON_CUSP
  - INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE_1
  - INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE_2
  - INPUT_COLLECT_ENERGY

These are the input files for the following steps. 


Step 1
------
First step: issue the following command

  $ ./1_locate_struct_on_cusp_v2
  
The following input files need to be in the same directory
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_1
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_2
  - INPUT_FIND_STRUCTURES_ON_CUSP 

This step will produce the following output file
  - initial_struct_on_cusp

Step 2
------
Second step: issue the following command

  $ ./2_find_min_on_cusp_v4
  
The following input files need to be in the same directory
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_1
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_2
  - initial_struct_on_cusp
  - INPUT_MINIMIZE_ON_CUSP
  - REFERENCE_FOR_ALIGNMENT
  
This step will produce the following output file
  - minimized_struct_on_cusp
  
Step 3
------
Third step: This step involves the sliding down part and composed of two separate calculations i.e.
            sliding down two wells. Issue the following commands 

  $ cp INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE_1 INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE
  $ ./3_desc_one_surface_v3

Wait for the calcualtion to finish, then issue the following commands

  $ cp INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE_2 INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE
  $ ./3_desc_one_surface_v3

The following input files need to be in the same directory for each calculation.
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_1
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_2
  - minimized_struct_on_cusp
  - REFERENCE_FOR_ALIGNMENT
  - INPUT_SLIDE_ONE_SURFACE

Ouput of these two calcualtions
  - OUT_COORDS_SURFACE_1_*
  - num_structures_written_1
  - OUT_COORDS_SURFACE_2_*
  - num_structures_written_2


  
Step 4
------
Fourth step: issue the following command

  $ ./4_collec_ener_v2
  
The following files need to be present the same directory
  - INPUT_COLLECT_ENERGY
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_1
  - INPUT_STRUCTURE_2
  - minimized_struct_on_cusp
  - REFERENCE_FOR_ALIGNMENT
  - All files with names OUT_COORDS_SURFACE_1_*, num_structures_written_1
  - All files with names OUT_COORDS_SURFACE_2_*, num_structures_written_2
  
Output
-  Files with names COORDS_IMAGE_1, COORDS_IMAGE_2, ... etc

Step 5
------
Issue the command by replacing NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES and NUMBER_OF_IMAGES with proper values.

  $ ./5_makepathway_v2 -n NUMBER_OF_PARTICLES -i NUMBER_OF_IMAGES -a 0
  
All the files with names COORDS_IMAGE_* gotten from the previous step should be present as
well as the "PDB_INFO" file gotten in step 0.
"NUMBER_OF_IMAGES" can be found in the output file "number_of_structures_in_pathway" 
obtained in the previous step.

Output: A PDB file called "pathway.pdb" with multiple models.
